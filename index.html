    Maker, where Makers and non-Makers, can enjoy reasonable accommodation in
    a quiet neighborhood, visit the Angkor Wat in a 20 minutes Tuk Tuk ride,
    and build <strong>things</strong>. The property is run by a Maker with
    enthusiasm for Unix, programming, IoT, and IT automation.</p><p>All rooms
    have private shower, fans, and A/C. No-frills, but clean and enough space
    for big suitcase(s). Practical amenities are provided for free, such as
    hair dryers, USB chargers, AC adapters, voice assistant speakers, and
    managed WiFi.  </p>"

    Our WiFi network is monitored 24/7, and managed by a professional network
    engineer. <a href="https://www.sinet.com.kh/" target="">SINET</a>,
    our ISP, is known as the best ISP in the country, with symmetric
    bandwidth, 60 Mbps, for upload and download, dedicated &amp; stable
    bandwidth over optical fibre, and one of the best domestic and
    international network backbone in Cambodia. The access line is NOT shared
    with neighbors, but dedicated to the property, i.e. "true" FTTH.</p>

    <p>In the spirit of <strong>Maker</strong>, the WiFi and Ethernet network
    are designed, built, and operated by a professional. WiFi signal at every
    room is constantly monitored for possible issues, and visualized for
    trends. We promise to all the guests that your complaints are taken
    seriously and issues will be resolved quickly and effectively.</p>

    <p>If you are a digital nomad, enjoy nice atmosphere at local cafes while
    you are working on your projects. But when you need reliable, dedicated
    network access, such as downloading and/or uploading big files, or
    important online meeting with your coworkers, manager, or clients, our
    network provides one of the best performance in the town.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, blackout happens occasionally in Siem Reap. We do not
    afford to an electric generator for the entire property. However, the
    network has dual links to the Internet, the optical fibre and 4G mobile
    network, which is often unaffected by blackouts, as a backup.</p>
