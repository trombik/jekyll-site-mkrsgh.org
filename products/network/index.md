## WiFi network

Here in <strong>Makers Guesthouse</strong>, in the spirit of
<strong>Maker</strong>, the WiFi and Ethernet network are designed, built, and
operated by a professional. WiFi signal at every room is constantly monitored
for possible issues, and visualized for trends. We promise to all the guests
that your complaints are taken seriously and issues will be resolved quickly
and effectively.

Each floor has at least two WiFi access points, with 802.11a/b/g. 802.11n is
available at the ground floor. The WiFi network covers public area, such as
balconies, the front yard, and the back yard.

## The uplink

Our uplink is provided by one of the best enterprise ISP, SINET. The fibre
optic line provides <em>true</em> FTTH with symmetric bandwidth (60 Mbps for
both directions, 120 Mbps in total). The ISP provides responsible 24/7
support in case of issues.

If you are a digital nomad, enjoy nice atmosphere at local cafes (there are
many!) while you are working on your projects. But when you need reliable,
dedicated network access, such as downloading and/or uploading big files, or
important online meeting with your coworkers, manager, or clients, our network
provides one of the best performance in the town.

### No-proxy

Proxying by ISPs is a common business practice in the regions, not only in
Cambodia. Unlike CDN edge proxies, which is a valid service by CDN providers,
the proxy _service_, or _wiretapping_, is a practice for ISPs to _cache_ your
traffics, which has caused unexpected issues, and is very difficult to
diagnose. Our ISP does not wiretap.

## Backup uplink

Unfortunately, blackout happens occasionally in Siem Reap. We do not
afford an electric generator for the entire property. However, the
network has dual links to the Internet, the optical fibre, and 4G mobile
network, which is often unaffected by blackouts, as a backup. The media
converter, the gateway router, and Ethernet switches are powered by UPS.

<strong>Limitations:</strong> The 4G mobile link has limited bandwidth. The
backup access line is used to maintain the minimal business operations. As
such, public WiFi access for guests is limited in a designated area, the
lobby.
